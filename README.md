# PizzeriaDelivery
This is a console application where users can create an account and order pizza.
## About
* This console application uses a register and login system with database file to create an user account 
* If the database text file doesn't exist the function for creating an account will also create the file
* The data from the text file is saved and ready to be used later, even after the console application has finished and closed
* For the login process the users data from the text file is transferred to a linked list where each node represents an user and contains user credentials and details
* The email address and password validation and other operations with user data are made with different linked list functions
